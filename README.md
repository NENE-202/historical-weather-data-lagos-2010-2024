# Historical Weather Data Analysis for Lagos (2010–2024)

## Project Overview
This project analyses historical weather data for Lagos from 2010 to 2024 to identify rainfall trends, seasonal patterns, and potential flood risk indicators.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning, feature engineering, pivot tables)
- Looker Studio (dashboard and KPI visualisation)
- Google Docs / PowerPoint (reporting)

## Data Preparation
- Converted raw data into structured tables
- Checked for missing values
- Created helper columns: Year, Month, Season, Rainfall Intensity, Flood Risk Flag

## Analysis Performed
- Annual rainfall trend analysis
- Monthly rainfall averages to identify seasonality
- Identification of flood-prone months and years
- KPI creation for quick insights

## Key Insights
- Higher rainfall observed in months such as May, July, August, and December
- Years like 2012, 2016, 2020, and 2024 showed increased rainfall intensity
- Flood risk varies across seasons and years

## Limitations
- No direct flood occurrence data; rainfall was used as a proxy
- No missing values limited demonstration of data imputation techniques

## Recommendations
- Improved urban drainage systems
- Early warning systems during peak rainy months
- Integration of flood event data for stronger analysis
