# Historical Weather Data Analysis for Lagos (2010–2024)

## Why This Project Matters
Lagos is highly vulnerable to flooding due to heavy seasonal rainfall, rapid urbanization, and drainage challenges. Flooding disrupts transportation, damages infrastructure, and affects public safety and economic activities. Analyzing historical weather data provides valuable insights into rainfall patterns and potential flood-risk periods, supporting better planning and disaster preparedness.

---

## Business Problem It Solves
Urban planners, emergency response teams, and infrastructure managers often lack clear, data-driven insights into **when flood risks are highest** and **how rainfall patterns change over time**. This leads to reactive rather than proactive planning.

This project addresses that challenge by analyzing historical rainfall data to identify seasonal trends, high-risk periods, and key indicators that can inform flood mitigation strategies.

---

## How Insights Support Decision-Making
The insights from this analysis help decision-makers to:
- Anticipate peak rainfall and flood-prone periods
- Prioritize drainage maintenance and infrastructure upgrades
- Improve early warning and preparedness strategies
- Support long-term flood-resilient urban development planning

---

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical weather data for Lagos from **2010 to 2024**, focusing on rainfall trends and inferred flood-risk indicators. Using Excel for exploratory data analysis and Looker Studio for visualization, the project uncovers seasonal patterns, high-risk months, and annual rainfall trends relevant to flood risk assessment.

---

## Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to:
- Analyze annual and monthly rainfall trends in Lagos
- Identify seasonal rainfall patterns and flood-prone periods
- Develop KPIs that summarize rainfall and flood-risk indicators
- Create an interactive dashboard for easy interpretation of insights
- Highlight data limitations and propose actionable recommendations

---

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel** – data cleaning, feature engineering, pivot tables
- **Looker Studio** – interactive dashboard and KPI visualization
- **Google Docs / PowerPoint** – reporting and presentation

---

## Data Preparation & Feature Engineering
- Converted the dataset into a structured Excel table
- Checked for missing values (none detected)
- Created helper columns including:
  - Year
  - Month
  - Season (Dry / Rainy)
  - Rainfall Intensity
  - Flood Risk Flag

---

## Analysis Performed
- Annual rainfall trend analysis
- Monthly rainfall averages to reveal seasonality
- Identification of flood-prone months and high-risk years
- KPI creation for summarized insights

---

## Key Insights
- Higher rainfall is consistently observed in **May, July, August, and December**
- Years such as **2012, 2016, 2020, and 2024** recorded increased rainfall intensity
- Flood risk varies across seasons, with higher risk during the rainy season

---

## Limitations
- No direct flood occurrence data; rainfall was used as a proxy for flood risk
- Lack of flood event records limited validation of findings
- Absence of missing values limited demonstration of data imputation techniques

---

## Recommendations
- **Upgrade drainage systems:** Modernize and expand drainage infrastructure to reduce waterlogging during peak rainfall periods.
- **Develop flood-resilient infrastructure:** Design and retrofit roads and buildings to withstand heavy rainfall and periodic flooding.
- **Raise public awareness:** Educate residents, urban planners, and builders on proper drainage maintenance to prevent blockages.
